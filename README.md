Day by day the cases of Cardiovascular diseases are increasing at a rapid rate and it's
very important and concerning to predict beforehand. Approximately every one minute a
person dies due to heart disease. So, there is a need for a reliable, accurate and
feasible system to diagnose such disease in time for proper treatment. It is one of the
most complicated tasks in the field of clinical data analysis. Various machine learning
techniques have been applied to predict heart diseases. This paper aims at finding
significant features by applying several machine learning algorithms resulting in build on
the accuracy in the prediction of cardiovascular disease. Different combinations of
features and several known classification techniques were introduced in this prediction
model. The severity of the disease is classified based on various methods like
K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm(KNN), Decision Trees(DT), Genetic algorithm(GA) and
Naive Bayes(NB). Also introduced the Hybrid Random Forest with the linear
model(HRFLM), which produces high accuracy in the prediction of heart disease.

!!!We just compare these algorithms to see which has the best accuracy!!!
